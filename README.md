Sonntag, Darrell B., Hanyong Jung, Royce P. Harline, Tyler C. Peterson, Selah E. Willis, Taylor R. Christensen, and James D. Johnston. “Infiltration of Outdoor PM2.5 Pollution into Homes with Evaporative Coolers in Utah County.” Sustainability 16, no. 1 (January 2024): 177. https://doi.org/10.3390/su16010177.

Note: 5/10/2024 we discovered that the UDAQ pollution data was in UTC time, not in MDT time. This causes a slight difference in some of the graphs in the supplemental information between the 2024 paper, and the updated graphics in the repository. In general the correlation between the study and UDAQ PM2.5 data increases slightly, as would be expected. We have updated this for our Ozone paper
