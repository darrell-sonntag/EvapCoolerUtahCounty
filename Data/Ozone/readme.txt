11/29/2023 I created a copy of the ozone data. 

Ozone Data Corrected.xlsx from Ozone Data.xlsx

In the Data tab, H02 V1, H03 V1 and H04 V1 the outdoor are under the LOD. But in the Central tab. The values have changed from outdoor to indoor. 

Have we documented these changes to the data?

Discrepancies in Indoor and outdoor values (that I could find): 
H02 V1
H03 V1
H04 V1

In the copy version, in the data tab, I changed the Location (in/out) for those 3 visits.

I noticed that the ozone data has these following visits
H05 V2
H10 V2
H17 V2
H19 V2
H16 V3

However, in the Research Data Master List it has these visits occuring in the winter:
In the corrected data set (data tab), I changed the visits to this:
H05 V3
H10 V3
H17 V3
H19 V3
H16 V4

SampleID 001 from the lab report. The Total Volume is with Sample 001 in the ozone Data.xlsx, but the mass and concentration are in Sample 004

On the ozone .xlsx sample 004 is Out and Sample 001 is in. 

Sample ID 002, Volume is also sample 002 in the ozone Data, but the mass and concentration for sample ID 002, are different in the ozone spreadsheet. 

We can't find the data from Sample ID 003, 004, 007, 008 in the lab reports.

Laboratory Analysis Master Key.xlsx created, saved in Box in Ozone folder - DO NOT EDIT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES

Ozone Data Corrected.xlsx corrected to match master list - as suspected, data for samples 001-009 was incorrect

Dr. Sonntag changed the LOCATION for the following samples from IN to OUT, or from OUT to IN. 
I am 99.99% sure, the samples were mislabled in the indoor and outdoor concentrations. They are the ONLY samples where the outdoor concentrations > indoor concentrations. Also, they are the ONLY samples where the OUTdoor concentrations were below the detection limit.

002
003
004
007
008

Dr. Sonntag changed H2 and H3 in Ozone Data Corrected.xlsx to H02 and H03

Han changed the date of H03 V3 from Aug 2nd to Aug 8th.
